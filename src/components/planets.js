    name: "Mercury",
    shortDescription: "The smallest planet and closest to the Sun.",
    longDescription: {
  "Position & Size": "Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System, with a diameter of 4,879 km and a mass of 3.3 × 10²³ kg. Its size is comparable to Earth’s Moon, and like the Moon, it has a heavily cratered surface. Despite its small size, Mercury is remarkably dense, indicating a disproportionately large metallic core.",
  "Physical & Orbital Properties": "The planet has a surface gravity of 3.7 m/s² and an escape velocity of 4.25 km/s. Mercury completes an orbit around the Sun in 88 Earth days. Its orbit is highly elliptical, with an eccentricity of 0.206, making it one of the most elongated orbits among planets. The planet’s rotational period is 59 Earth days, creating a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, meaning it rotates three times on its axis for every two orbits around the Sun.",
  "Surface & Temperature": "Mercury’s surface resembles that of the Moon, with vast plains, impact craters, and cliffs known as scarps, which were formed as the planet cooled and contracted. The absence of a significant atmosphere allows surface temperatures to fluctuate dramatically, ranging from scorching 430°C in the day to freezing -170°C at night. The Caloris Basin is one of the largest impact basins in the Solar System, stretching 1,550 km across.",
  "Atmosphere": "Mercury has an extremely thin exosphere instead of a true atmosphere. It consists of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. The gases are constantly replenished by solar wind, micrometeorite impacts, and radioactive decay. Because it is so tenuous, this exosphere cannot trap heat, leading to Mercury’s extreme temperature variations.",
  "Internal Structure": "Mercury has a disproportionately large iron core, estimated to make up about 85% of its radius. Surrounding the core is a thin silicate mantle and crust. Evidence suggests that part of the core remains molten, which contributes to Mercury’s weak but detectable magnetic field. This core dominance explains Mercury’s high density compared to its size.",
  "Magnetic Field": "Mercury’s magnetic field is only about 1% as strong as Earth’s, but it still creates a small magnetosphere. MESSENGER spacecraft data revealed that this magnetic field is asymmetrical, being stronger in the northern hemisphere than in the southern. Scientists believe this irregularity is due to the offset of its partially molten core.",
  "Exploration History": "Mariner 10, launched in 1973, was the first spacecraft to visit Mercury, capturing images of about 45% of its surface. NASA’s MESSENGER orbiter (2004–2015) provided comprehensive mapping and discovered evidence of water ice in permanently shadowed craters. The joint ESA-JAXA mission BepiColombo, launched in 2018, is en route and expected to arrive in 2025 to provide further insights.",
  "Unique Features & Significance": "Mercury’s combination of high density, large iron core, thin exosphere, and temperature extremes make it unique. The discovery of water ice in such a hostile environment highlights how even small planets may preserve volatile materials. Culturally, Mercury was named after the Roman messenger god, associated with speed, reflecting its swift orbit around the Sun."
